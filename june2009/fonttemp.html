                <h4>Cyber Smoothie Cafe</h4>
                <p>In the Las Vegas area?  Want to try something new?  Check out the <a href="http://cybersmoothiecafe.com" title="Website design for the Cyber Smoothie Cafe">Cyber Smoothie Cafe</a>.</p> 
                <p>The owner, Mr. Randy Parker, is a great person all around. Offering many services, from smoothies to great water, to health supplements, this store is everything you expect and more. Back before I started being a full-time freelance designer, I used to take my lunches at the Cyber Smoothie Cafe every day; my personal favorites are the India Smoothie, Arctic Chill, Honeydew Heaven (boba), the Coconut boba, and I love to request chocolate in my Coconut boba (it tastes great!)</p>

                 <h4>Kim</h4>
                <h5>Freelance Designer.  Cheesecake afficionado.</h5>
                <p>While in high school, Kim began to learn this thing called the Internet. She'd worked on it before - she remembers when table-based layouts were the way to go, and when design was a simple thing. Now, she's got years of experience under her belt, and is building a portfolio charged with logos, poster illustration, graphics, and of course, website design. Want great work with thought put in it? Then you want some of Kim's designs.</p>
                
                <h4>Sam</h4>
                <h5>Content Slave.</h5>
                <p>Ever wonder how someone could possibly hold a career doing nothing but writing site content? It certainly takes a very amazing person - and that's our Sam. While we're sure he's fallen asleep a few times trying to plod through the next one thousand words, his writing voice will draw your clients in - and make them want more.</p>

                <p>With some articles already being published in Script &amp; Style, I've really found that I enjoy the world of blogging about design, with the occasional touch on personal development (though, most often, design).  Subscribe at the following link with your favorite reader, and get my infrequent updates.  I only post when I'm really inspired - so there's no real set "date" on updates.</p>

                 <p>Contact me today (with the box over there ->) to get a quote today, or just ask what I can do for you.  I've got several years of experience doing everything web and graphic related (well, okay, I'm still learning some PHP functions), and can get you exactly what you need.  Whether you just want a small business site, or a personal site or portfolio, nothing is too big or too small.  I love all types of design; I can do minimalist, or I can give you in-your-face graphics.  Just ask, and I'll see what I can do. </p>
